<h3> Given these images of famous dancer Maddie Ziegler, it is evident that dancers are trained to hide their exhuastion, anxiety, and perfectionism. Often times dancers mask their true emotions to perform and appear perfect. <h3>

<h1><i> Narrative/Rationale </i></h1>
<p> When choosing how I wanted to conduct my second component of my portfolio I wanted to create something visually appealing to the eyes yet also interesting. I decided to code my own informational website about my topic and included interactional aspects on it for viewers. I wanted to do this, because coding is something that I am skilled at and having a website that is interactional keeps my audience engaged. Not only does this multimodal project include visual, linguistic and spatial elements but it also has interaction which could make them feel more a part of the learning experience. I wanted to do something that is unique and something that most people do not do when it comes to multimodal texts. Websites to me are useful because they contain useful information from one source. 
Initially, I considered adding onto my poster I made for the journal 8 entry, but I decided I wanted to show off my skills and my knowledge on the topic of dancers' mental health. I envisioned that my audience would be those in the dance world, specifically teenage girls and even the parents of those teens, and also my professor. Which is why I included ways for users to interact to make education also fun. I wanted my audience to feel seen by using statistics to put into perspective of how important their mental health is. The dancers themselves were the most important audience to me given my goal is to find ways to implement a positive environment in the dance world. My understanding of my audience was that dancers who are viewing the website already have an idea of how dancers' mental health can be impacted. As a result, I included statistics about eating disorders, mental health in general and holistic pre professional training to teach them more about their mental health that they may not have been aware of before. I am hoping to instill a reaction or a realization for girls who potentially are suffering in silence. The statistics could allow them to realize they are not alone and I as the author of the website want to help them. In fact, for this project I used stasis of fact as my main rhetorical source. I was hoping that in these efforts I could use statistics as my evidence making it harder to dismiss and argue, therefore strengthening the message of my work. And although I used stasis of fact the most, the greatest rhetorical decision I made was my purpose. I used my text to emphasize the importance of this topic and to persuade dancers to reach out for help if they need it. I wanted this source to perform as an educational and persuasive outlook on the topic.
On the other hand, the part of this project that I found most difficult was creating an impact with my words while keeping the website relatively upbeat. I needed to convey the seriousness of the topic while making my page approachable. I was confident in my ability to have an impact on my viewers but I did not want the website to be, for a lack of other words, depressing. I coded light colors and images to make the website appear to be welcoming but the text I coded was the harsh realty. I wanted my website to resemble how dancers seem perfect on the outside but behind that they are actually going through many struggles. My goal for this website was to create something new and interesting for my viewers but also grasp dancers and maybe non-dancers' attention to the intense issue at hand.<p>
